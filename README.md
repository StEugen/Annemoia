# Annemoia
Annemoia is an open source DevSecOps tool designed to analyze codebases for potential vulnerabilities and run security tests that emulate how attackers might exploit weaknesses. Built in Python 3, Annemoia aims to empower developers and security teams by automating vulnerability analysis, providing actionable insights, and integrating seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines.

Note: This project is still in development.

## Features
- Code Vulnerability Analysis: Scans source code for known vulnerabilities and insecure coding practices.

- Security Testing Suite: Runs tests to simulate various hacker attack scenarios.

- Command-Line Interface (CLI): A simple and intuitive CLI tool (ann) for quick scanning and reporting.

- Extensible: Plugin architecture and modular design make it easy to add new security tests and integrations.

- Reporting: Generates detailed reports with actionable recommendations to improve code security.
